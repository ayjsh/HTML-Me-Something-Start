Â  <h1>My Music Career</h1>
      </header>
      <main>
  <p>I've gotten to do a lot of pretty cool things in my time as a professional musician over the past 20 or so years. I've always felt most at home performing, whether it was as a member of a band, a hired gun, working in the church, studio work, or as a solo artist.
   I was a member of the bands Shattered, The Marquette Weekend, The Great Romance and The Lone Rangers (I'm still a part of this one!) As a hired gun, I toured with and/or backed up Brooke Barrettsmith (Sony Records/American Idol), Elle Limebear, Stu G, Aaron Shust, JJ Weeks, Relient K, Jeremy Lopez, Kenny DeShields, Lloyd Nicks, Brad Miller, Nathan Smith, Pillar, Superchick, and Seventh Day Slumber.
   <br><br>
   On top of performing, I have worked as a producer and engineer in the studio, a writer for other artists, and taught music both privately and in a school setting.  </p>
